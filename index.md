## The Pirate NFT Club
Pirate NFT Club is a project by two people, Uma and Sowmya. We think of this club as a place to learn how to create and mint ERC721 NFTs. Learn how to stake your NFTs and how to bring your NFTs to the metaverse. We will soon be launching a collection of tools to simplify the process of NFT creation and minting. Finally, we will launch a P2E game where you can use the PirateNFTClub NFTs to play.

## Why should you buy our NFTs
- Our NFTs are not just collectibles, they can be used in the P2E game we will be launching
- We will be launching tools and utilities for NFT minting, owners of our NFTs will have unlimited access to resources.
