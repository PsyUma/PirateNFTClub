## The Pirate NFT Club
Pirate NFT Club is a project by two people, Uma and Sowmya. We think of this club as a place to learn how to create and mint ERC721 NFTs. Learn how to stake your NFTs and how to bring your NFTs to the metaverse. We will soon be launching a collection of tools to simplify the process of NFT creation and minting. Finally, we will launch a P2E game where you can use the PirateNFTClub NFTs to play, earn and trade NFTs.
